Origin: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk
Change: 2d5789eca89658a7f0a01e2d6010c0f254605d72

This is the contents of src/boads, src/common,
src/rp2040, and src/rp2_common, excluding cmake
goop.

I suspect we'll trim it back closer to just the
register definitions, but for now leave it mostly
as-is to simplify updating as the pico sdk updates
and we figure out how deeply (or not) to integrate
it with lk.
