# Random TODO list

[github issue list](https://github.com/littlekernel/lk/issues)

To fix:
+   arm64 arch_ops.h - arch_cycle_count is bogus
+   x86 arch_ops.h - switch to builtin atomics
+   riscv - exception decode can be a negation test (top bit set)
+   arm arch_ops.h left over pre-armv6 stuff
+   see about expanding cycle count to a ulong
+   lib console make read only blocks
